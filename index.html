                <h5>Current Progress, October 11, 2021</h5>
                <p><I> “ Hearing is basically a specialized form of touch. Sound is simply vibrating air which the ear
                    picks up and converts to electrical signals, which are then interpreted by the brain. The sense of
                    hearing is not only the sense that can do this, touch can do this too. ”（Glennie 2015）</I></p><br>

                <p>What kind of sound does our skin listen to ? What does soundscape mean for remote communication ?
                    With the inspiration of sound process and vibrascape, 《Keep In Sonic Touch》is a research lead
                    project aimed to experiment with the information soundscape captured by skin. </p><br>
                <p><I> “ The vibroscape is the entire set of substrate or airborne vibrations that is present in a
                        specific portion of a geographical area. ” （Sturm et al. 2018）</I></p><br>
                <div class="fakeimg"><img src=img/demo.png width="30%" height="30%"></div><br>
                <p>If a soundscape contains so much landscape information, when it is transformed as vibration, can the
                    soundscape captured on our skin be designed as a tangible interface for people feeling closer when
                    communicating remotely ? With these questions, I started a wearable device which aims to translate
                    the sounds into tactile information, concretized as a tangible interface to make people feel closer
                    when communicating from a distance. <br><br>
                <div class="fakeimg"><img src=img/prototypingprocess_1.JPG width="30%" height="30%"></div><br>
                <p>​​In the first stage of prototyping, I started with a local server version, combining contact microphone,
                arduino uno, a mobile vibration motor and a MaxMSP patcher. Skin is the human body's largest organ,
                It contains lots of physical environment information which influences the human body. It is the first
                contact interface which sound and soundscape deliver to human's body intuitively. Therefore, I started to
                think about turning it into some information for tangible and tactile sensation. With the limitation of the motor, in
                the current prototyping stage, the vibration is only triggered by the soundscape's volume. In terms of the information
                of the soundscape, spectrum analysis will be the next step. Meanwhile, the internet and a wearable device combining contact 
                microphone and vibration motors with the laptop is still working in progress. Keep in touch if you are interested in the project. <br><br>
